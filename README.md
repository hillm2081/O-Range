# O-Range

This project is meant to act as a friendly demo to hunting, teaching how to conduct a hunt ethically. In typical hunting settings, the hunter has an array of equipment, most commonly a rifle, binoculars, orange clothing, regulation booklets, tags, some device to watch the time, etc. In this game, the most used items are contained, but can only be used two at a time. This is not only to gamify the experience, but to demonstrate the act of balancing multiple pieces of equipment to ensure everything is completed legally, and ethically. For example, you must keep track of the time if you are hunting in the morning, or evening, while wearing orange clothing for safety.

The user can change what equipment they are using to a maximum of two equipped consecutively. They can be switched whenever. Each hunt is randomly generated, with a random amount of encounters, randomly assigned either "buck", "doe", or "human". 

Each item has a purpose that benefits the user, and most of them have withdrawls for when they arent equipped. For example, Orange clothing allows the user to be seen by another human when they encounter one, whereas if they aren't wearing one they will be shot

The biggest challenge was dealing with timers. I have a timer running to manage the entire hunt, and a second one to count passage of time in the inventory screen. Since I had the hunting timer essentially tied with every aspect of the game, it was hard to keep track of how to implement content. There's probably like 80 if statements.
